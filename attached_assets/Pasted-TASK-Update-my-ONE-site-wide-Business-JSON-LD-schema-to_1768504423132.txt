TASK: Update my ONE site-wide Business JSON-LD schema to use the Alvin address as the ONLY physical location.

CONTEXT:
- This is a Next.js 15 App Router site.
- The business schema is currently injected site-wide from app/layout.tsx (RootLayout).
- I want to REPLACE the existing business schema (currently using Friendswood) with an updated one using Alvin.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Keep ONLY ONE HVACBusiness/LocalBusiness schema site-wide.
- Do NOT create multiple business entities.
- Do NOT add or keep any Friendswood physical address in the schema.
- Friendswood should remain ONLY as an areaServed city (service area), not an address.
- Do NOT remove the existing city-page WebPage schemas (if present). Only update the Business schema.
- After updating, ensure every page outputs the updated Alvin-based business schema.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- In app/layout.tsx, locate the existing businessSchema object (or JSON-LD Script block) and replace its JSON with the exact JSON below.
- Keep the injection method the same (next/script + dangerouslySetInnerHTML or equivalent).

REPLACE WITH THIS EXACT JSON-LD:

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": ["HVACBusiness", "LocalBusiness"],
  "@id": "https://www.mabryac.com/#business",
  "name": "Mabry’s Air Conditioning & Heating, Inc.",
  "url": "https://www.mabryac.com/",
  "telephone": "+1-281-482-8400",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "2110 S Gordon",
    "addressLocality": "Alvin",
    "addressRegion": "TX",
    "postalCode": "77511",
    "addressCountry": "US"
  },
  "foundingDate": "1986",
  "description": "Residential AC & heating services since 1986. Honest flat-rate pricing with no hidden charges.",
  "priceRange": "$$",
  "serviceType": [
    "Air conditioning repair",
    "Heating repair and maintenance",
    "Air conditioning installation"
  ],
  "areaServed": [
    {
      "@type": "City",
      "name": "Friendswood",
      "address": { "@type": "PostalAddress", "addressRegion": "TX", "addressCountry": "US" }
    },
    {
      "@type": "City",
      "name": "Pearland",
      "address": { "@type": "PostalAddress", "addressRegion": "TX", "addressCountry": "US" }
    },
    {
      "@type": "City",
      "name": "Alvin",
      "address": { "@type": "PostalAddress", "addressRegion": "TX", "addressCountry": "US" }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Place",
      "name": "Clear Lake (Houston)",
      "address": { "@type": "PostalAddress", "addressRegion": "TX", "addressCountry": "US" }
    }
  ],
  "additionalProperty": [
    { "@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Texas HVAC License", "value": "TACLB12058E" },
    { "@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "BBB Rating", "value": "A+" }
  ]
}

AFTER YOU IMPLEMENT IT:
- Confirm by checking https://mabryac.com page source:
  View Page Source → search "HVACBusiness" and "2110 S Gordon"
- Also check a city page like /areas/pearland to confirm the same updated business schema appears site-wide.
