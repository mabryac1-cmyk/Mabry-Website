TASK: Add ONE site-wide JSON-LD schema for my business across every page.

PROJECT: Next.js 15+ App Router (Replit)

WHERE TO ADD IT:
- Edit: app/layout.tsx
- Add the JSON-LD inside the <head> of RootLayout so it appears on ALL pages.
- Use next/script (import Script from "next/script") and inject JSON with dangerouslySetInnerHTML.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Create ONLY ONE business schema entity total.
- Use ONLY ONE physical address (Friendswood) in the schema.
- DO NOT add addresses for Pearland, Alvin, or Clear Lake.
- Use areaServed to represent service areas.
- Do NOT create separate schemas per city.

USE THIS EXACT JSON-LD (do not change wording except to match existing code style):

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": ["HVACBusiness","LocalBusiness"],
  "@id": "https://www.mabryac.com/#business",
  "name": "Mabry’s Air Conditioning & Heating, Inc.",
  "url": "https://www.mabryac.com/",
  "telephone": "+1-281-482-8400",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "3404 Volterra Circle",
    "addressLocality": "Friendswood",
    "addressRegion": "TX",
    "postalCode": "77546",
    "addressCountry": "US"
  },
  "foundingDate": "1986",
  "description": "Residential AC & heating services since 1986. Honest flat-rate pricing with no hidden charges.",
  "priceRange": "$$",
  "serviceType": [
    "Air conditioning repair",
    "Heating repair and maintenance",
    "Air conditioning installation"
  ],
  "areaServed": [
    {
      "@type": "City",
      "name": "Friendswood",
      "address": { "@type": "PostalAddress", "addressRegion": "TX", "addressCountry": "US" }
    },
    {
      "@type": "City",
      "name": "Pearland",
      "address": { "@type": "PostalAddress", "addressRegion": "TX", "addressCountry": "US" }
    },
    {
      "@type": "City",
      "name": "Alvin",
      "address": { "@type": "PostalAddress", "addressRegion": "TX", "addressCountry": "US" }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Place",
      "name": "Clear Lake (Houston)",
      "address": { "@type": "PostalAddress", "addressRegion": "TX", "addressCountry": "US" }
    }
  ],
  "additionalProperty": [
    { "@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Texas HVAC License", "value": "TACLB12058E" },
    { "@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "BBB Rating", "value": "A+" }
  ]
}

AFTER YOU IMPLEMENT IT:
- Confirm it appears on the live homepage HTML:
  View Page Source → search for: application/ld+json
- Confirm it also appears on a city page (ex: /areas/pearland) the same way.
