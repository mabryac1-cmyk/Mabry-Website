TASK: Update my ONE site-wide Business JSON-LD schema to use the Alvin address and the updated phone number.

CONTEXT:
- This is a Next.js 15 App Router website built in Replit.
- The business schema is injected site-wide from app/layout.tsx (RootLayout).
- I want to REPLACE the existing HVACBusiness/LocalBusiness schema with an updated version.
- The ONLY change from the current correct schema is the phone number.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Keep ONLY ONE HVACBusiness/LocalBusiness schema site-wide.
- Do NOT create multiple business entities.
- Do NOT add or keep any Friendswood physical address in the schema.
- Friendswood must remain ONLY as an areaServed city (service area), not an address.
- Do NOT remove any existing WebPage schemas on city pages (/areas/*).
- Only update the Business schema.
- Ensure the updated schema appears on EVERY page via app/layout.tsx.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- In app/layout.tsx, locate the existing business schema object or JSON-LD <Script>.
- Replace its contents entirely with the JSON below.
- Keep the same injection method (next/script with application/ld+json).

REPLACE WITH THIS EXACT JSON-LD (do not modify):

  ]
}

AFTER IMPLEMENTATION:
- Open https://mabryac.com
- View Page Source → search for "HVACBusiness"
- Confirm the phone number shows as +1-281-331-5248
- Open a city page (ex: /areas/pearland) and confirm the same updated schema appears there.
